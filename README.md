# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to build a webpage which details some of the main commands or pointers when using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I wanted to build this project to help anyone who is new to the world of coding by summarising each section.
As its easily assessible it will help me have something to refer back to and help as an aid throughout the course. I learned a great deal within this project, in HTML I was able to go through the different elements used to display content on a webpage. 
Within CSS I was able to understand how to then control the layout of that HTML webpage using style sheets. I.e. being able to control the colour, font, sizing of text, spacing between elements, linking CSS style into HTML and much more.
I then download Git Bash and was able to work in the Command line which taught me the importance of always knowing what branch I was currently working in, create new branches and switching to that branch and push and pulling commit commands to the main repository.
The JavaScript tutorials taught me it is used to program the behaviour of web pages already created. For example variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code, functions is a block of JavaScript code that can be executed when "called" for and array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value.
